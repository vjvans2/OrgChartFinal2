This is an MVC project that turns .CRV files into Organizational Lists through the use of Google Charts and Google JS API.  

How To Use:
 - Download everything and run the solution.  
 - Running the application will show a FileUpload button to select a .CRV file.  Press the second button to turn the .CRV file into an Organizational List.  
 - After successfully creating a list, the option to enter an EmployeeId becomes available.  Select an employeeId in the number box and press the accompanying button to see a list of information about the Employee.  Below the primary organizational chart is a secondary chart that only shows the chosen employee and their direct reporters, if applicable.  If there are no direct reporters, text will say so.
